* Write a simple Python class named Student and display its type. Also, display the __dict__ attribute keys and the value of the __module__ attribute of the Student class.

The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. 'pass' can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level.

Expected output:

```
<class 'type'>
dict_keys(['__module__', '__dict__', '__weakref__', '__doc__'])
__main__
```
