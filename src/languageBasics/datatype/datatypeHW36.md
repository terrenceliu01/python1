* Write a Python program to find the elements in a given set that are not in another set.

for given two sets:

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

{4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Expected output:

```
Original sets:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
{4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Difference of sn1 and sn2 using difference():
{1, 2, 3}
Difference of sn2 and sn1 using difference():
{8, 6, 7}
Difference of sn1 and sn2 using - operator:
{1, 2, 3}
Difference of sn2 and sn1 using - operator:
{8, 6, 7}
```
