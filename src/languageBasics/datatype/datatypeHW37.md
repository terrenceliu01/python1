* Write a Python program to remove the intersection of a 2nd set from the 1st set.

for given two sets:

s1 = {1,2,3,4,5}

s2 = {4,5,6,7,8}

Expectged output:
```
Original sets:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
{4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Remove the intersection of a 2nd set from the 1st set using difference_update():
{1, 2, 3}
Remove the intersection of a 2nd set from the 1st set using -= operator:
{1, 2, 3}
```
