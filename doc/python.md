‚ùìWhat is OOP? What are differences between Functional Programming and OOP
‚úîÔ∏è4 Features of OOP
  1. Abstraction:class is a abstraction of object in real world to python program object type.ÔºàÂÆû‰ΩìÊ®°ÊãüÔºâ
  2. Inheritance: a class can inherit from multiple other class to increase code reusability.ÔºàÂÖ±ÊÄßÁªßÊâøÔºâ
  3. Polymorphism:same function behavior differently by different object type.ÔºàÂºÇÁ±ªÂêåÂäüÔºâ
  4. EncapsulationÔºöavoid data or function being called outside the class unintentionallyÔºàËá™Êàë‰øùÊä§)

* [raiseError.py](../src/function/raiseError.py)
* [assertCheck.py](../src/function/assertCheck.py)

the differenct between raise and assert:
1. assert: I swear this must bt true, help developer
2. raise: try to catch run-time error. sometime developer will use raise to control execution flow.

‚ùìWhat is Database?
>‚úîÔ∏èA database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches.

‚ùìWhat is DBMS?
>‚úîÔ∏èDBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software responsible for the creation, retrieval, updation and management of the database. It ensures that our data is consistent, organized and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database and its end users or application softwares.

‚ùìWhat is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
>‚úîÔ∏èRDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key difference here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2 and Amazon Redshift are based on RDBMS.

‚ùìWhat is SQL?
>‚úîÔ∏èSQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.

‚ùìWhat are Tables and Fields?
>‚úîÔ∏èA table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.

‚ùìWhat are Constraints in SQL?
>‚úîÔ∏èConstraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during creation of table or after creationg using the ALTER TABLE command. The constraints are:

Constraints| Description
|---       |---         | 
NOT NULL   |Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
CHECK      |Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
DEFAULT    | Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
UNIQUE     |Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
INDEX      |Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
PRIMARY KEY|Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
FOREIGN KEY|Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.

‚ùìWhat is Primary Key?
>‚úîÔ∏èThe PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.
A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields (columns).

* [Create, PRIMARY KEY](../src/sqlite/sqlite0.py)

‚ùìWhat is UNIQUE constraint?
‚úîÔ∏èA UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. This provides uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row uniquely. Unlike primary key, there can be multiple unique constraints defined per table. The code syntax for UNIQUE is quite similar to that of PRIMARY KEY and can be used interchangeably.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with a single field as unique */
    ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
    Name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with multiple fields as unique */
    ID INT NOT NULL
    LastName VARCHAR(255)
    FirstName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    CONSTRAINT PK_Student
    UNIQUE (ID, FirstName)
);

ALTER TABLE Students 	 /* Set a column as unique */
ADD UNIQUE (ID);

ALTER TABLE Students 	 /* Set multiple columns as unique */
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Student 	 /* Naming a unique constraint */
UNIQUE (ID, FirstName);
```

‚ùìWhat is a Foreign Key?
‚úîÔ∏èA FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refer to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between two tables.
The table with the foreign key constraint is labelled as the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is labelled as the referenced or parent table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Supplier (
  SupplierNumber INTEGER NOT NULL,
  Name           VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  Address        VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT supplier_pk PRIMARY KEY(SupplierNumber),
  CONSTRAINT number_value CHECK(SupplierNumber > 0)
)

CREATE TABLE Invoice (
  InvoiceNumber  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  Text           VARCHAR(4096),
  SupplierNumber INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT invoice_pk PRIMARY KEY(InvoiceNumber),
  CONSTRAINT inumber_value CHECK (InvoiceNumber > 0),
  CONSTRAINT supplier_fk
    FOREIGN KEY(SupplierNumber) REFERENCES Supplier(SupplierNumber)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT
)
```

‚ùìWhat is an Index? Explain its different types
‚úîÔ∏èA database index is a data structure that provides quick lookup of data in a column or columns of a table. It enhances the speed of operations accessing data from a database table at the cost of additional writes and memory to maintain the index data structure.

* Unique and Non-Unique Index:
>Unique indexes are indexes that help maintain data integrity by ensuring that no two rows of data in a table have identical key values. Once a unique index has been defined for a table, uniqueness is enforced whenever keys are added or changed within the index.

* Clustered and Non-Clustered Index:
>Clustered indexes are indexes whose order of the rows in the database correspond to the order of the rows in the index. This is why only one clustered index can exist in a given table, whereas, multiple non-clustered indexes can exist in the table.

‚ùìWhat is the difference between Clustered and Non-clustered index?
>‚úîÔ∏è the differences can be broken down into three small factors 
1. Clustered index modifies the way records are stored in a database based on the indexed column. Non-clustered index creates a separate entity within the table which references the original table.
2. Clustered index is used for easy and speedy retrieval of data from the database, whereas, fetching records from the non-clustered index is relatively slower.
3. In SQL, a table can have a single clustered index whereas it can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

‚ùìWhat is a Query?
‚úîÔ∏èA query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. 
1. select query or 
2. an action query.

‚ùìWhat is a Subquery? What are its types?
‚úîÔ∏èA subquery is a query within another query, also known as nested query or inner query .
1. A **correlated subquery** cannot be considered as an independent query, but it can refer the column in a table listed in the FROM of the main query.
2. A non-correlated subquery can be considered as an independent query and the output of subquery is substituted in the main query.

‚ùìWhat are some common clauses used with SELECT query in SQL?
‚úîÔ∏èSome common SQL clauses used in conjuction with a SELECT query are as follows:
1. WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records that are necessary, based on specific conditions.
2. ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the records based on some field(s) in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC).
3. GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group records with identical data and can be used in conjuction with some aggregation functions to produce summarized results from the database.
4. HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter records in combination with the GROUP BY clause. It is different from WHERE, since WHERE clause cannot filter aggregated records

‚ùìWhat is Cursor? How to use a Cursor?
‚úîÔ∏èA database cursor is a control structure that allows for traversal of records in a database.
```sql
DECLARE @name VARCHAR(50) 	 /* Declare All Required Variables */

DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR FOR 	 /* Declare Cursor Name*/
SELECT name
FROM myDB.students
WHERE parent_name IN ('Sara', 'Ansh')

OPEN db_cursor 	 /* Open cursor and Fetch data into @name */ 
FETCH next
FROM db_cursor
INTO @name

CLOSE db_cursor 	 /* Close the cursor and deallocate the resources */
DEALLOCATE db_cursor
```

‚ùìWhat are Entities and Relationships?
‚úîÔ∏è**Entity:** An entity can be a real-world object, either tangible or intangible, that can be easily identifiable. For example, in a college database, students, professors, workers, departments, and projects can be referred to as entities. Each entity has some associated properties that provide it an identity.
‚úîÔ∏è**Relationship:** Relations or links between entities that have something to do with each other. For example - The employees table in a company's database can be associated with the salary table in the same database.
* one-to-many & Many-to-one
* Many-to-Many
* Self Referencing Relationship: This is used when a table needs to define a relationship with itself.

‚ùìWhat is a View?
‚úîÔ∏èA view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

‚ùìWhat is Normalization?
‚úîÔ∏èNormalization represents the way of organizing structured data in the database efficiently. It includes creation of tables, establishing relationships between them, and defining rules for those relationships. Inconsistency and redundancy can be kept in check based on these rules, hence, adding flexibility to the database.

‚ùìWhat is Denormalization?
‚úîÔ∏èDenormalization is the inverse process of normalization, where the normalized schema is converted into a schema which has redundant information. The performance is improved by using redundancy and keeping the redundant data consistent. The reason for performing denormalization is the overheads produced in query processor by an over-normalized structure.

‚ùìWhat are the TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP statements?
‚úîÔ∏è

‚ùìWhat is PL/SQL Stored Procedure?
‚úîÔ∏èA stored procedure is a set of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements with an assigned name, which are stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) as a group, so it can be reused and shared by multiple programs.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE procedure_name(arg1 data_type, ...) AS
BEGIN
  ....
END procedure_name;

CREATE OR REPLACE procedure_name(arg1 data_type, ...) AS
BEGIN
  ....
END procedure_name;
```

‚ùìWhat is function
‚úîÔ∏è
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE
FUNCTION calculate_score
( cat IN VARCHAR2
, score IN NUMBER
, weight IN NUMBER
) RETURN NUMBER AS
BEGIN
  RETURN NULL;
END calculate_score;
```
